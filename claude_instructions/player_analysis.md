# FPL MCP Server Enhancement Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Overview

### Current Limitations
The current FPL MCP server has a fundamental limitation: it restricts access to the full player dataset, making comprehensive analysis difficult. The `find_players` tool is limited to returning only 5 players by default, which prevents Claude from performing meaningful analysis across the entire player pool.

### Enhancement Goals
We need to implement three powerful tools that provide:
1. Full player dataset analysis with filtering capabilities
2. Enhanced fixture analysis for players, teams, and positions
3. Comprehensive player comparison with gameweek history

### Architecture Changes
We'll preserve the existing MCP structure while adding new tools that enable full-dataset access and analysis. We'll utilize caching to optimize performance and minimize API calls.

## 2. Files to Review

Start by reviewing these files to understand the existing codebase:

1. `src/fpl_mcp/__main__.py` - Main entry point with existing tools
2. `src/fpl_mcp/fpl/api.py` - API interface for FPL data
3. `src/fpl_mcp/fpl/cache.py` - Caching implementation
4. `src/fpl_mcp/fpl/resources/players.py` - Player data handling
5. `src/fpl_mcp/fpl/resources/fixtures.py` - Fixture data handling
6. `src/fpl_mcp/fpl/tools/comparisons.py` - Existing comparison tools

## 3. Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Implement Position Normalization Utility

Create a new file: `src/fpl_mcp/fpl/utils/position_utils.py`

```python
"""Utilities for normalizing position terms in FPL context."""

from typing import Optional

# Comprehensive position mapping dictionary
POSITION_MAPPINGS = {
    # Standard FPL codes
    "GKP": "GKP", "DEF": "DEF", "MID": "MID", "FWD": "FWD",
    
    # Common variations - singular
    "goalkeeper": "GKP", "goalie": "GKP", "keeper": "GKP",
    "defender": "DEF", "fullback": "DEF", "center-back": "DEF", "cb": "DEF",
    "midfielder": "MID", "mid": "MID", "winger": "MID",
    "forward": "FWD", "striker": "FWD", "attacker": "FWD", "st": "FWD",
    
    # Common variations - plural
    "goalkeepers": "GKP", "goalies": "GKP", "keepers": "GKP",
    "defenders": "DEF", "fullbacks": "DEF", "center-backs": "DEF",
    "midfielders": "MID", "mids": "MID", "wingers": "MID",
    "forwards": "FWD", "strikers": "FWD", "attackers": "FWD"
}

def normalize_position(position_term: Optional[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    """Convert various position terms to standard FPL position codes.
    
    Args:
        position_term: Position term to normalize (can be None)
        
    Returns:
        Normalized FPL position code or None if input is None
    """
    if not position_term:
        return None
        
    # Convert to lowercase for case-insensitive matching
    normalized = position_term.lower().strip()
    
    # Try direct match in mapping (case insensitive)
    for term, code in POSITION_MAPPINGS.items():
        if normalized == term.lower():
            return code
            
    # Try partial matches
    for term, code in POSITION_MAPPINGS.items():
        if normalized in term.lower() or term.lower() in normalized:
            return code
            
    # No match found, return original
    return position_term
```

### Step 2: Implement Enhanced Caching for Player Dataset

Modify `src/fpl_mcp/fpl/cache.py` to add a new function:

```python
# Add to existing cache.py file

async def get_cached_player_data():
    """Get cached complete player dataset with computed fields.
    
    Returns:
        Complete player dataset with additional computed fields
    """
    return await cache.get_or_fetch(
        "complete_player_dataset",
        fetch_func=fetch_and_prepare_all_players,
        ttl=3600  # Refresh hourly
    )

async def fetch_and_prepare_all_players():
    """Fetch all players and add computed fields.
    
    Returns:
        Enhanced player dataset with computed fields
    """
    # Get raw player data from API
    from .api import api
    from .resources.players import get_players_resource
    
    # Fetch complete player dataset with all fields
    all_players = await get_players_resource()
    
    # Add computed fields for each player
    for player in all_players:
        # Calculate value (points per million)
        try:
            points = float(player["points"]) if "points" in player else 0
            price = float(player["price"]) if "price" in player else 0
            player["value"] = round(points / price, 2) if price > 0 else 0
        except (ValueError, TypeError, ZeroDivisionError):
            player["value"] = 0
            
        # Other useful computed fields can be added here
            
    return all_players
```

### Step 3: Implement Enhanced Player Analysis Tool

Add to `src/fpl_mcp/__main__.py`:

```python
from .fpl.utils.position_utils import normalize_position

@mcp.tool()

    sort_by: str = "total_points",
    sort_order: str = "desc",

### Step 6: Implement Enhanced Player Comparison Tool

Add to `src/fpl_mcp/__main__.py`:

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def compare_players(
    player_names: List[str],
    metrics: List[str] = ["total_points", "form", "goals_scored", "assists", "bonus"],
    include_gameweeks: bool = False,
    num_gameweeks: int = 5
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Compare multiple players across various metrics
    
    Args:
        player_names: List of player names to compare (2-5 players recommended)
        metrics: List of metrics to compare
        include_gameweeks: Whether to include gameweek-by-gameweek comparison
        num_gameweeks: Number of recent gameweeks to include in comparison

    }
    
    return comparison
```

## 4. Verification Steps

After implementing the changes, perform the following tests:

### Test 1: Enhanced Player Analysis Tool

1. Test with basic filtering:
   ```
   /analyze_players position="midfielders" min_price=8.0 limit=10
   ```
   
2. Test with multiple filters:
   ```
   /analyze_players position="defenders" max_price=5.0 min_points=50 sort_by="value" sort_order="desc"
   ```
   
3. Test with gameweek history:
   ```
   /analyze_players team="Liverpool" include_gameweeks=true num_gameweeks=3
   ```

Verify:
- Position normalization works correctly
- Proper filtering is applied
- Results are sorted as specified
- Summary statistics are accurate
- Gameweek history is included when requested

### Test 2: Fixture Analysis Tool

1. Test player fixture analysis:
   ```
   /analyze_fixtures entity_type="player" entity_name="Salah" num_gameweeks=5
   ```
   
2. Test team fixture analysis:
   ```
   /analyze_fixtures entity_type="team" entity_name="Arsenal" num_gameweeks=5
   ```
   
3. Test position fixture analysis:
   ```
   /analyze_fixtures entity_type="position" entity_name="forwards" num_gameweeks=5
   ```

Verify:
- Correct fixtures are returned
- Difficulty assessment is reasonable
- Blank and double gameweeks are identified
- Position-based analysis provides useful team recommendations

### Test 3: Player Comparison Tool

1. Test comparing two players:
   ```
   /compare_players player_names=["Salah", "De Bruyne"]
   ```
   
2. Test comparing multiple players with gameweek history:
   ```
   /compare_players player_names=["Haaland", "Kane", "Vardy"] include_gameweeks=true
   ```
   
3. Test with custom metrics:
   ```
   /compare_players player_names=["Robertson", "Alexander-Arnold"] metrics=["assists", "clean_sheets", "bonus", "price"]
   ```

Verify:
- Players are found correctly
- Metrics comparison is accurate
- Gameweek history is included when requested
- Best performers are identified correctly

## 5. Logging and Error Handling

1. Log function entry points with parameters
2. Log errors in detail
3. Return clear error messages to Claude
4. Handle edge cases gracefully (player not found, invalid filters, etc.)

## 6. Final Implementation Notes

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Make sure all imports are correct
   - Ensure dependencies are installed

2. **Important Considerations**:
   - Position normalization is critical for natural language interaction
   - Caching is essential for performance - hourly refresh is reasonable
   - Always return useful summaries alongside detailed data
   - Structure data for easy visualization by Claude

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update docstrings to clearly explain parameters and return values
   - Log any changes to the existing API

This implementation plan provides a clear, step-by-step approach to enhancing the FPL MCP server's capabilities while preserving the existing architecture. The junior engineer should be able to follow these instructions to implement the three main tools and the supporting functions needed for them to work efficiently.
